    "In the following, we will consider the simplest problem that can be encountered in machine learning. We have an unknown function $x\\rightarrow f(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and a set of points $\\mathcal{S}=\\{f\\left(x_i\\right), x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ sampled from our function $f$. The goal is to find an approximate function of $f$ that is satisfactory for the real-world problem at hand. We will see in the following how neural network, with the help of deep learning, can handle these problems. The learning process where the correct answer $f(x_i)$ for each input $x_i$ is known is called supervised learning, as it is similar to a teacher knowing the answer and guiding the student to it."
