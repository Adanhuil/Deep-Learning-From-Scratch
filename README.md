# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch

Building neural network architecture from scratch in a comprehensible manner in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). We do not use any specific examples and focus on the mathematical structure of neural networks.

## Perceptron Architecture :
- Build the fully connected neural network
- Explain how to use gradient descent to train a neural network
- Deep learning using backpropagation algorithm

A useful reference is [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) from Andrew W. Trask.

## Attention unit :
- Coming soon, hopefully...
